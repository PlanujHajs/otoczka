# Convex Hull Calculator

An interactive application that calculates the convex hull of a set of points on a plane. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, with a clean UI powered by shadcn/ui.

## About the Project

This application solves the following task:

### Convex Hull of a Set of Points
The program determines the convex hull of points on a plane and:
- Identifies what type of shape the convex hull is (polygon, quadrilateral, triangle, line segment, or point)
- Displays the coordinates of consecutive vertices of the convex hull

**Input data:** Coordinates of points on a plane.

## Features

- Real-time convex hull calculation and visualization
- Clear identification of the resulting geometric shape
- Responsive design that works across devices

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
